# Fullstackopen-PDF
This is the Open source PDF Version of the University of Helsinki's FullStackOpen course, it's meant to augment and not replace the actual course which can be found [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en), I in no way take credit for the materials in the book, I am merely a translator (so to speak). All Copyright goes to the Univeristy of Helsinki's FullstackOpen Team and their partners.
